## Adapter Pattern

Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

### When to Use Adapter Pattern
  * When an outside component provides captivating functionality that we'd like to reuse, but it's incompatible with our current application. A suitable Adapter can be developed to make them compatible with each other
  * When our application is not compatible with the interface that our client is expecting
  * When we want to reuse legacy code in our application without making any modification in the original code
